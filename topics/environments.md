Currently the conventions are:

* **local** - your local machine
* **staging / qa** - the staging or QA build environment, where code is built, integrated and tested, a replica of production for staging. Built and tested code for product owner review, before release.
* **production** - what it says on the tin. Code released here is available to customers.
