This handbook outlines our general approach to engineering and contains everything you need to know to start contributing code at Senwes Applications.

Specific project detail should live with specific projects - but everything should inherit and extend the principals within this handbook.

All updates to the handbook are peer-reviewed by engineers at Senwes Applications and it represents our shared wisdom and values about our development practices, culture, and how projects should be put together.

### An Important Note

One of the key aspects of Senwes Applications is individuality. We often debate various things internally, and projects can have inconsistencies from each other. Sometimes, this is a good thing. The flip side of consistency can be monoculture, where experimentation is discouraged.

Engineers can often get caught up in issues like “what’s the best way to do this?”. While we obviously want to work from the best possible starting position. Take the best that’s available and make sure it is peer-reviewed.

Experiment. Deconstruct. Rebuild. Blow it all away and start from scratch.

Some of the best projects come from a dissatisfaction with the status quo. If there are things in this guide you disagree with, fix them. Nothing will ever be perfect. Maybe something that’s annoying you today turns into a better tool for everyone tomorrow. <b>Make sure to do knowledge sharing and get your suggestions reviewed and approved before implementing.</b>

This guide is a living set of documents, and will be updated as we continue to refine, refactor, and rebuild our processes and tooling.
### Q. Who can update the handbook?

A. Anyone at Senwes Applications Simply branch the repo[^1] and have at it. When you’re done raise a pull request for review.
### Q. What if I encounter code that doesn’t follow the approach in this handbook?

A. Congratulations. You have a free pass to propose changes/improvements to align with standards described in this handbook. See the [charter](topics/charter.html) and our commitment to fixing broken windows.
