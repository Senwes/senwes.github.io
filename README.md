# Senwes Engineering Handbook

This handbook outlines our general approach to engineering and contains everything you need to know to start contributing code at Senwes Applications.

Specific project detail should live with specific projects - but everything should inherit and extend the principals within this handbook.

All updates to the handbook are peer-reviewed by engineers at Senwes Applications and it represents our shared wisdom and values about our development practices, culture, and how projects should be put together.
